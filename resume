After a career in the economic/touristic sector, I intend to relocate to IT, my
passion since the age of 5, with the goal of becoming Front-End / Web Developer
at first, to then expand my knowledge and studies also to the Back-end,
Software development or what the future challenges will require of me.
Since 2015 I have been studying assiduously through various US E-Learning
courses such as HarvardX CS50, Android Basics Nanodegree by Google,
CodeAcademy, freeCodeCamp (continuously deepening languages like Python3,
SQLite, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and several of its frameworks, Jinja3 and
others), with the purpose of improving my coding skills and always keeping up
with the modern technologies and skills required by the market.
Continuously updated and curious to learn everything that has to do with
coding and technology, currently I’ve started to study for the Cisco CCNA 200-125 and I’m
deepening my Python knowledge to enhance my networking skills. I am open to
learn any language proposed. Links to my Portfolio are available at the
"Known Technologies" CV section.
